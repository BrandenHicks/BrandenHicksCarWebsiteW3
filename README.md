As a final project for my web desgin class I was tasked with creating a car dealership site on the front-end with HTML and W3-CSS. In terms of responsiveness, the project is barebones. You're able to navigate through the different pages. This project includes a home, information, invetory, locations, services, and a special deal page. With HTML being the structure, W3-CSS enabled me to create a "skin" for the project instead of allowing it to look like a blank word document. This was one of my first attempts of integrating what I learned about HTML and CSS. Since this was created in 2019, I think I would fare better in creating a more responsive and aesthetically pleasing webpage.
